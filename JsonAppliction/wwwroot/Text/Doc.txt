Json
*******************
What is json?
--------------
==> JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
==>JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
==>JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
==>JSON is used to send data between computers
==>JSON is language independent *
Why Use JSON?
You can receive pure text from a server and use it as a JavaScript object.
You can send a JavaScript object to a server in pure text format.
You can work with data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.
--JSON.parse()--json string to javaScript object
--JSON.stringify()--javascript object to json string

JSON Syntax Rules
-----------------
JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays
JSON Values
------------
In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:
a string
a number
an object
an array
a boolean
null
In JavaScript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including:
a function
a date
undefined
In JSON, string values must be written with double quotes:{"name":"John"}----JavaScript:{name:'John'}

JavaScript Arrays as JSON
--------------------
The same way JavaScript objects can be written as JSON, JavaScript arrays can also be written as JSON.
JSON Files
--------------------
The file type for JSON files is ".json"
The MIME type for JSON text is "application/json";
---------------------------------------------
 JSON is Like XML Because
 ************************************
Both JSON and XML are "self describing" (human readable)
Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest
---------------
JSON is Unlike XML Because
*********************************
JSON doesn't use end tag
JSON is shorter
JSON is quicker to read and write
JSON can use arrays
----------------------------
Valid Data Types
********************************
In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:
a string
a number
an object (JSON object)
an array
a boolean
null
-----------------
JSON.parse()
***************************
A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.

When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.

Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.
